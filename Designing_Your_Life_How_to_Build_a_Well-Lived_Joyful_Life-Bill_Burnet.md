Things you can't change. Stay away from them or learn to live with them.

# Ideate your life

You can design 3 different lives. 3 different 5 year plans.
What would you do if you had enough money and you didn't care about what people thought?
By imagining the other life plans, you can bring things back that you left behind in the back burner of your mind.

# Prototype

Before you choose a life, just try it first.
You can Prototype experiences by having conversations that are living the life that you are considering living.

# Choosing well

We have so many choices, how do you choose an option?

- gather and create
- narrow down (reduce choice overload, we can't handle more than 5 choices)
- choose (you need to chose)
- let go and move on (get rid of the fear of missing out)
