# know can do! by ken blanchard, Put your know-how into action

In today's we are overflown by information.

We read many books and don't get much of it. Why? Ken argues that it's because applied learning is necessary for learning.
It does not matter how many new ideas we learn about, what matters is the time that we spend applying those ideas into our lives.
He reccommends instead of reading more less times, he reccommends going over the ideas and apply the principles more. Read less, more.
