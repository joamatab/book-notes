## The crazy monkey mind

The crazy monkey goes from branch to branch because he never finds a branch that he likes.

Some of us are like that monkey in the sense that we are never happy with the present moment.

Rafael tells a Buddhist story of a little frightened mouse who is really afraid of cats.
One day a magician appears and decides to turn it into a cat.
Soon, the cat starts to be afraid of dogs, so the magician, starting to feel annoyed turns him into a dog.
However, a few days later the new dog finds out about a big tiger nearby, so the magician quite annoyed already turns him into a tiger, the king of the jungle.
The new tiger happiness did not last long either, as he started to be worried about a human hunter.
Finally, the magician turns him back into mouse and tells him: That's it, i turned you into a mouse and won't transform you again, later he tells him: Dear friend, you have to learn how to be happy being a mouse first, otherwise nothing will make you happy

## 4. The method

The cognitive therapy model to change behavior consists of getting rid of the irrational beliefs that we have in our minds and sabotage us.

- it's terrible that this happens to be
- I cannot take it anymore
- The world does not work well

Rafael's method of turning irrational beliefs into rational beliefs

- First, you need to identify unhappy moments and find out the root cause of distress
- Second, we unmask that logic with opposite arguments
- Finally we reframe them with rational belief that will make us feel better

## 4. Rational visualizations

Many professional players leverage visualizations to prepare their minds to achieving some goals

There are 2 main types of visualization

- Full happy life visualization. For example we want to learn to live in solutide so you visualize yourself enjoying your single life.
- See your self calm in a stressful situation. If you are worried about anything, like going to the dentist, you can visualize yourself living through tha situation in a calm way.

The full life visualization  

1. Connect with good times. Remember a time where you felt happy and strong (physically and mentally), as you walk on the street you feel great being yourself
2. Be in harmony with your current life situation
